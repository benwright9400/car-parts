1. Database design:

Part table design
	- id : Integer (Primary key)
	- Name : varchar
	- SKU : varchar(6)
	- Description : varchar
	- OnSale : Boolean
	- StockCount : Integer
	- Manufacturer : (foreign key linking to manufacturer id) Integer

Manufacturer table design:
	- id : Integer (primary key)
	- Name : varchar
	- PartsOnSale : Boolean


Implemented as migrations then models were assigned to each table.
Resource controllers were then linked to each model.
